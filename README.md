# Visualize Uncertainty Interface

This repo is for the design and build for the Visualize Uncertainty project interface, a research paper accepted into the IEE Vis 2018 Conference in Berlin. 

## Design

The design files live inside the "design" folder and include prototypes for:
- Context: How to create a storytelling intro to describe the context of the web app
- Filters: How to filter the artworks database by Bertin's visual variables clearly
- Sliders: How to adjust the value of each visual variable in line with the nuance of uncertainty

## Build

The build files live inside the "index.html" file and were built on the following principles:
- Widget style modules using custom HTML elements and shadow DOM
- Javascript and d3.js for data visualization
